## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **OpenWeather API**: Provides weather data used in the application.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Vite plugin for React with Babel for Fast Refresh.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**: (Optional) Vite plugin for React with SWC for Fast Refresh.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and ensuring responsiveness.

## Approach

The development process of this app involved the following steps:

1. **UI Construction**: Designed and built the user interface, ensuring a clean and user-friendly experience.
2. **API Integration**: Integrated the OpenWeather API to fetch and display weather data based on user input or current location.
3. **Location Feature**: Implemented functionality to fetch and display weather data for the user's current location.
4. **Responsiveness**: Ensured the application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- **Single City Search**: Currently, the application only supports searching for weather information of one city at a time. 
- **Error Handling**: There might be limited error handling for various edge cases, such as invalid city names or network issues.
- **API Key Exposure**: Ensure your API key is not exposed publicly. Consider using environment variables and server-side code to handle API requests in a production environment.
